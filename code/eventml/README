--- How to run EventML?

In Emacs:

Once you have installed Emacs and EventML, you should be able to open
in Emacs any file with the extension ".eml" and start using the tool.
You can type declarations in your eml file and evaluate expressions
in an EventML session.  To start a session on an eml file, click on
the "EventML" button that should be next to the "Help" button and then
on "Session".

In a terminal:

To start a session in a terminal, run:
  eventml file.eml --lib path_to_your_alldefs.eml
                   --nuprl-defs path_to_your_alldefs
                   --session

The alldefs file is provided in the source archive.  The alldefs.eml
file is generated when you run "make" (after configure -- see the
INSTALL file for more details on how to install EventML).
